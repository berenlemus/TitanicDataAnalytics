# TitanicDataAnalytics

## Description
This Python script loads the Titanic dataset from a CSV file, performs various data exploration and visualization tasks using libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. It provides insights into the dataset by displaying summary statistics, counts of categorical variables, and visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and bar diagrams.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
2. Place the Titanic dataset file ("titanic.csv") in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Run the Python script (`titanic_analysis.py`).
4. The script will load the dataset, display the first and last few rows, and provide summary statistics.
5. Various visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and bar diagrams will be generated to explore relationships and distributions within the data.

## Files
- `titanic.csv`: The Titanic dataset file containing passenger information.
- `titanic_analysis.py`: The main Python script for data analysis and visualization.
- `README.md`: This file providing information about the script and dataset.

## Features
- Loads the Titanic dataset from a CSV file.
- Provides basic data exploration functions such as displaying the first and last few rows, random sample, data types, and summary statistics.
- Performs visualization tasks including scatter plots, histograms, and bar diagrams to explore relationships and distributions in the data.

## Note
- Ensure that the Titanic dataset file ("titanic.csv") is in the same directory as the Python script.
- You can modify the code to perform additional analysis or visualization tasks based on your requirements.
- This script serves as a starting point for exploring the Titanic dataset, providing insights into passenger demographics and characteristics.

## Credits
- Inspired by tutorials and resources on data analysis and visualization with Python, pandas, and matplotlib.
